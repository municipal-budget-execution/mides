# Budget Execution

Budget execution refers to the implementation of the annual budget that is approved by the local legislature. While much of the analytical work presented in this paper focuses on budget execution of public procurement, the tables on budget execution include all activities performed by municipalities, including payment of salaries, transfers, and others[^1].

The budget execution process in Brazil is similar to that in other countries[^2]. It consists of three distinct steps: commitment, verification, and payment. The commitment (_empenho_) phase is the moment when governments set aside part of the budget appropriated to them for a specific activity, such as buying goods from a supplier or paying salaries of health workers. From a budgetary perspective, this is often seen as the moment an expenditure is recognized, since committed amounts are deducted from the budget appropriation. The second step of the budget execution is the verification (_liquidação_). It occurs when the government acknowledges that a certain service or good has been provided. This is the equivalent of recognizing a debt with a provider and is considered an expenditure from an accrual accounting point of view. In fact, if an expenditure was verified but not paid, it is recorded as accounts payable (_restos a pagar processados_), and, as with firms, increases in this amount might reflect a deterioration in the ability of governments to meet short-term obligations[^3]. The final step of the budget execution is the payment (_pagamento_), when governments transfer the money to their suppliers. 

## Data 

Our municipal budget execution dataset is organized into three tables: _commitment_, _verification_, and _payment_.

In the _commitment_ table, one observation is a commitment by one agency in a given municipality. Commitments vary from very large expenses, such as the commitment for the entire wage bill of the mayor's office in a month, to very specific commitments such as the acquisition of replacement parts for a car. Each commitment is often linked to four levels of "functional programming" that map the nature of a commitment (such as Transportation > Road Transportation > Road Recovery > Recovery of a specific road in a given street), as well as a text that explicitly describes the nature of the commitment[^4]. After an initial commitment, officials can increase or decrease the amounts committed as well as annul them. Across municipalities in our dataset, the quality of tracking these actions after initial commitment varies, but we include initial, increases, annulments, adjustments, and net amounts for each commitment when these are available. Each commitment is also linked to a unique identifier ($id\_empenho\_bd$) that allows users to connect a commitment to verification and payments linked to them.

In the _verification_ table, observations are verifications by some agency in a given municipality, which are always linked to a specific commitment. The key information available for each verification is the date when they happen, the initial value verified, any adjustments to the original value and the final value. One commitment might generate one or more verifications, so each verification is uniquely identified by the variable $id\_liquidacao\_bd$ and can be connected to commitments by the variable $id\_empenho\_bd$.

Finally, for the _payment_ table, each observation is a payment made to a specific entity. Payments can often (but not always) be linked back to a specific verification. The key information available in the payments table is the date of payment and values. The dataset also includes variables with the names and "document number" of payees - these are often unique national identifiers for individuals (CPF) and firms (CNPJ) but are not available for all payments or municipalities. Again, one verification event can lead to one or multiple payments, so payments are uniquely identified by the variable $id\_pagamento\_bd$ and can be linked back to verification events by $id\_liquidacao\_bd$ and to commitments by $id\_empenho\_bd$.

### Descriptive statistics

Statistics for the budget execution dataset are presented in \autoref{tab:descriptive_budget}. Our budget execution dataset includes over 880 million observations - over 250 million commitments, around 300 million verifications and over 300 million payments. For all three stages of the budget execution, we present the total number of observations and the total number of _distinct_ events - in some cases, we are unable to assess whether two commitment observations, for example, refer to the same commitment or not. In those cases, we set our respective identifier variable to missing to flag to users that we are unsure whether these are unique events that can be tracked across datasets. Using the budget classification discussed previously, we estimate that between 25%-35% of total budget commitment events are related to the procurement of goods and materials - this is a sample we exploit in more detail in the coming Sections. We also show that for an overwhelming proportion of commitments values are non-zero and can be matched to some verification and payment - allowing us to track the entire cycle of budget execution. We also highlight that our dataset currently encompasses over 3.5 trillion BRL in payments (in 2021 prices) or the equivalent of 38% of GDP in 2021, made to over 9 million different unique agents (identified by national tax IDs).

### Validation
The flagship dataset for information on municipal public finances in Brazil is the _Sistema de Informações Contábeis e Fiscais do Setor Público Brasileiro_ (SICONFI)[^5]. SICONFI contains self-reported information on municipalities revenues, expenditures, and balance sheets starting in 1989, with details on amounts per category and budget execution phase (i.e. commitment, verification, payment). These data have been extensively used and validated in empirical research using data on public finances in Brazil \citep{gadenne_tax_2017,CorbiEtAl2019,shamsuddin_economic_2021}. Moreover, the federal government performs several checks to guarantee an adequate level of quality. Our data is much more granular than SICONFI, measuring individual commitments, verification and payments, but once we aggregate at levels such as municipality-year we should expect to match totals from SICONFI. A natural validation of the quality of our dataset therefore is to compare our aggregates with those provided by SICONFI[^6].

In Figure 1, we present the histogram of the percentage deviation of _committed amounts_ from SICONFI, across states. Our key takeaway is that for five states (CE, MG, PB, PE and SP), our aggregates are almost identical to those from SICONFI - for each state, over 75% of deviations are below 1%, and often precisely zero. For PR, RJ and RS our deviations are centered around zero but with larger mass slightly above or slightly below - in both states three-quarters of deviations are in the range [-0.5%, 5%], but with more mass for larger absolute deviations in some municipality-years. We also present the same deviations but considering total committed amounts at the municipality-year-function level, where one observation is, for example, the total amount committed by one city for the Health function in 2020. We present these results in Figure 2, again documenting that our measures of aggregate commitments closely follow those available at SICONFI.

We also provide the distribution of deviations from SICONFI in verification and payment amounts in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. Here our concordance with SICONFI is less precise - while PB and SP show very small deviations, in the remaining states we systematically _overestimate_ total amounts of verification and payments. The distributions of deviations are somewhat similar across states, centered at around 5%-8% and with some mass up to 15%-20% in some municipality-years - meaning that the aggregate amount in our data exceeds that in SICONFI by that amount. These deviations do not seem to be driven by specific municipalities or to be systematically different across years, suggesting that there are consistent differences between our measures of verification and payments and those of SICONFI.

While we are unable to precisely explain those differences, we expect they are partly driven by amounts carried over across fiscal years, the so-called _restos a pagar_. In most states we are  unable to assert whether payments in a given year were committed and/or verified in the previous year; furthermore, annulments of verifications and cancellations of payments can be common, and are not always precisely measured in our dataset. We believe both of these factors might drive the systematic overestimation of aggregate amounts in our dataset compared to SICONFI. Finally, we also highlight that results in both our dataset and SICONFI are self-reported by municipalities, meaning there could be systematic discrepancies not due to errors in one source, but due to inconsistent reporting by subnational agents.

While we document that in some states we systematically overestimate total amounts verified and paid, these deviations $D_{mt}$ are only weakly correlated with municipal characteristics. We perform a predictive OLS exercise regressing $D_{mt}$ on a list of observables including each municipality's log population and log GDP per capita. In \autoref{tab:deviations_correlates} we report results from regressions with only year fixed effects in odd columns and with year and state fixed effects in even columns. In odd columns we find that deviations are negatively correlated with $ln(Population)$ and positively correlated with $ln(GDP)$. For both deviations in commitment and verification amounts, these correlations become much smaller in magnitude and mostly not statistically different from zero once we include state fixed-effects. For deviations in payment amounts, we still observer marginally significant correlations (at 10% significance level) for both population and GDP - in column (6), a one log point increase in GDP correlates with 0.5 p.p. smaller deviation in payments, or about 12% of the mean. A one log point increase in GDP per capita roughly corresponds to going from p25 to p75 of the distribution, so this is a small magnitude.

In sum these results suggest that our data's aggregate deviations from SICONFI totals are partially correlated with municipalities' characteristics, although only weakly. Researchers using our data may want to control for such characteristics depending on the research question at hand.
