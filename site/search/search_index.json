We collect from several Brazilian states data provided by State Audit Courts (TCEs in Portuguese) about budget execution and procurements. Initially, we show this enforcement in working paper published by the World Bank with seven states. Here, we publish updates about our dataset with more States. We provide the original source, processing codes, queries, and other analyses.</p> <p>Our dataset on municipal budget execution currently cover ten of Brazil's twenty-seven states, highlighted in Figure 1: Cear\u00e1 (CE), Distrito Federal (DF), Esp\u00edrito Santo (ES), Goi\u00e1s (GO), Minas Gerais (MG), Para\u00edba (PB), Pernambuco (PE), Paran\u00e1 (PR), Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Rio Grande do Norte (RN), Rond\u00f4nia (RO), Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Santa Catarina (SC), S\u00e3o Paulo (SP), and Tocantins (TO). These are large states that cover a substantial share of the total number of municipalities (73%), population (75%), and GDP (83%) of the country according to 2021 data. Notably, our dataset only covers states in the South, Southeast and Northeast regions - data from the states in the North and Center-West regions are currently not available<sup>2</sup>. Our procurement dataset allows users to see information on specific tenders, such as the number, reserve price, and description of items being sold, the number of participants in competitive tenders, and the identity of participants and winning parties covering nine states: BA, CE, MG, PB, PE, PR, RS, SC, and TO. On the budget execution side, the data includes information on each commitment, verification (an important step in the budget spending when buyers recognize that a good or service was delivered), and payments, again allowing users to see the identity of payees and the amount and dates of each step of the budget execution. In particular, we can compute the time to pay a particular transaction by using the time elapsed between the verification and payment stages.</p> <p>Some States are in the process of collecting data, such as Bahia, Sergipe, and Mato Grosso.

As their role in service provision increased, so did their economic relevance - in Brazil, municipal procurement was equivalent to approximately 3% of GDP between 2002 and 2019, or about 25%-30% of total purchases by all levels of government - federal, state, and municipal (Thorstensen and Giesteira, 2021). </p> <p>Data on local governments are often only available at an aggregate level, e.g. the total amount of purchases of goods and services, the total amount spent on health services, and the total amount of accrued liabilities. Consequently, many simple yet important questions related to the public finances of these units remain unanswered. Which are the suppliers of local governments, and what are their characteristics (e.g., size, location)? What is the share of purchases that happen through competitive tenders versus non-competitive methods? When competitive auctions take place, what is the degree of competition?</p> <p>Another crucial dimension of local governments' finances is how they execute their budgets. While aggregate commitment and spending amounts are easier to come by, we know little about the details of the budget execution. For instance, how long does it take to pay suppliers after deliveries are recognized? Is there a large variability in the payment timeliness across purchases within the same government? Do governments treat suppliers equally regarding payment timeliness? Answers to these questions can shed new light on the effectiveness of local governments and on their interaction with other economic agents. Similarly, when facing liquidity constraints, do governments prioritize the payment of some government functions at the expense of others? Payment delays impose several costs on suppliers and might affect the provision of public goods (Flynn and Pessoa, 2014). The importance of this issue is reflected in several recent regulations and initiatives that governments implemented in an attempt to shorten payment terms<sup>2</sup>. Yet, the scarcity of granular data on the stages of the budget execution renders the answers to these questions elusive<sup>3</sup>.</p>"},{"location":"#acessing-database","title":"Acessing database","text":"<p>The database is hosted in BasedosDados.

According to \\citet{garcia-santana_understanding_2023}, government purchases are highly locally concentrated worldwide. This phenomenon may occur due to supply factors such as regional economic specialization and lack of a diverse local production sector, or frictions such as transportation costs, geography or information asymmetries. It may also be explained by demand factors such as buy-local policies. These policies are ubiquitous across countries, but there is limited evidence regarding whether governments unofficially favor local suppliers even if a formal buy-local policy does not exist. \\citet{garcia-santana_understanding_2023} provide compelling evidence that regional governments in Spain and France present home bias, i.e. they favor local suppliers.  </p> <p>In this section, we document the prevalence of local suppliers across Brazilian municipalities, measuring the share of purchases from local governments flowing to firms located in the same municipalities. No such information exists currently in Brazil due to the lack of consistent data on the identity of municipal government suppliers - an information gap we fill with our dataset. We merge the identity of around 575,000 suppliers in local contracts with information on which municipality they are registered in - given by the Cadastro Nacional de Pessoas Jur\u00eddicas (CNPJ), a dataset provided by the Ministry of Economy. We consider a firm local if it operates within the municipality, regardless of whether it is a headquarters or a branch.</p> <p>In \\autoref{fig:home_bias_state}, we present the distribution of the share of local purchases provided by suppliers located in the same municipality in each state, pooling all purchases from 2014 to 2021. PR and MG are the states in which local contracting is higher on average - the mean municipality observation purchases almost one-quarter of its goods and services from suppliers located in the same municipality. RS and CE have slightly lower averages but similar distributions. In contrast, PE and PB exhibit considerably lower levels of local firms contracting, with the entire distribution shifted to the left. However, it is worth noting that, within states, we still observe a large variation in the levels of local contracting. Take MG, for example, a state with more than 800 municipalities. According to our data, the municipalities of Baldim and Ibirit\u00e9 procured less than 10% of total purchases from firms located in the same municipality, whereas municipalities like Almenara and Taiobeiras procured over 60% from local suppliers.</p> <p>An important source of heterogeneity discussed in the public procurement literature, which might also affect the identity of suppliers, is the modality of purchase. In general, purchases can be divided into competitive and non-competitive tenders, as described in \\autoref{fig:desc_procur_methods}. The literature showing the effects of discretion on procurement outcomes documents that it may have potential negative impacts on efficiency and corruption \\citep{baltrunaite_discretion_2021, decarolis_rules_2020, palguta_manipulation_2017}. One explanation is related to favoritism, once lack of competition may favor government bureaucracy to engage in opportunistic behavior for private benefit by awarding contracts to local and/or connected firms. These supplier firms may not be the most efficient, leading to overpricing and other inefficiencies. Using Brazilian federal procurement data, \\cite{fazio_rethinking_2022} finds evidence that although public agencies use discretion to purchase higher-quality products, they also use it to favor firms that are politically connected, located in the same municipality as the government agency, larger, and older<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>In order to investigate this heterogeneity, in Figure 1 we present the distribution of the share of same-municipality suppliers by competitive and non-competitive tenders separately. Non-competitive tenders are those classified as a tender waiver (dispensa) or non-requirement tender (inexigibilidade)<sup>2</sup>. Under the assumption that buying from local suppliers reveals political favoritism and that this is more likely to be enacted in discretionary, non-competitive tenders, we would expect a much larger share of local suppliers in the latter modality. This is not what we document: the average share of purchases from local suppliers is very similar at approximately 20% for both modalities. We do observe more dispersion in non-competitive tenders: while the distribution for competitive ones shows concentration around the mean, in non-competitive tenders we observe both a larger share of municipalities for which almost no suppliers are local and also a larger share with large participation of local suppliers<sup>3</sup>.</p> <p>To analyze the supply-side factor, we present the share of same-municipality suppliers for municipalities below and above the median population, as illustrated in \\autoref{fig:home_bias_population}. Notably, the calculated median for our dataset, using the 2018 population, stands at 11,590. Within smaller municipalities, the range of economic activities tends to be narrower and less diverse. This likely translates to a scarcity of local businesses available to adequately address the requirements of the local government. In addition, even if there is a supplier for some purchase, smaller municipalities might lack local competition, which can result in higher prices being charged by local suppliers in comparison to suppliers located in more competitive markets. So it is possible that policy-makers in those small municipalities might actually encourage the participation of firms from other areas. We document a pattern of local purchases consistent with those conjectures: on average, municipalities with above-median population present a 7 p.p. higher share of local suppliers (25% vs. 18% for those below median), and the entire distribution of local purchases is shifted to the left for smaller municipalities. </p>"},{"location":"aplication/#timeliness-in-government-payments","title":"Timeliness in government payments","text":"<p>Another important dimension of procurement practices is the timeliness of payments.  Stretched payment terms increase the length of time between the payments for inputs and the receipt of cash from customers, increasing the working capital needs and financial expenses of suppliers. Previous research has documented the importance of trade credit terms for the performance of firms \\citep{checherita-westphal_governments_2016, breza_financial_2017}. In extreme cases, late payments can lead to default and bankruptcy.</p> <p>Governments across the world often take long to pay their suppliers: procuring entities take on average 100 days to pay firms, with vast variation across countries \\citep{bosio_public_2022}. This has several important implications. First, government purchases are a large share of the economy and a substantial revenue source for firms, affecting their future growth and employment trajectory \\citep{ferraz_procuring_2015}. When governments take long to pay their suppliers, they impose an additional financial cost on firms deciding to supply, and potentially exclude small and medium-sized firms that are more likely to be liquidity constrained \\citep{barrot_employment_2020}. Second, if firms understand these additional financial costs, firms may avoid competing for government contracts or, upon deciding to compete, only accept higher prices that make up for the additional liquidity necessary to finance themselves. In either case, that may reduce the cost-effectiveness of public purchases and/or lead to worsening of the quality of goods and services procured. Some government have explicitly introduced reforms to accelerate payment to suppliers: \\citet{barrot_employment_2020} discuss the impact of QuickPay, which decreased the payment delay from 30 to 15 days for small business in the U.S. in 2011; and Chile introduced the Centralized Payment Platform (PPC, Spanish acronym for Plataforma de Pagos Centralizados) in 2020, which centralized payments from purchasing units to the Treasury and started to enforce a 30-day limit to payments.</p> <p> <ol> <li> <p>In the Hungarian context, \\cite{szucs_discretion_2023} finds a similar result - winners of high discretion procedures are more likely to be domestically owned. On the other hand, contracts in high discretion procedures tend to be awarded to younger and smaller firms.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>The first one consists of cases in which competition would be feasible, but the government chooses not to carry out the tender process - which is possible under a specific threshold established by procurement law. On the other hand, non-requirement occurs when competition is impossible (i.e. only one possible supplier, acquisition of unique goods or hiring of specialized professionals).\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>It is worth mentioning that we can only calculate this measure for suppliers whose national identifier consists of 14 digits - firms with a CNPJ. In our dataset we also have individual suppliers, registered with an 11-digit identifier (CPF). For those cases, we can not identify whether the purchases are more or less local, but we do know that non-competitive tenders represents a larger share of total number of purchases for individual suppliers (63%) than for firms (24%). If individual suppliers - which tend to be smaller - are more local, we might expect the distribution in the second panel to be shifted to the right.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"budget_execution/","title":"Budget Execution","text":"<p>Budget execution refers to the implementation of the annual budget that is approved by the local legislature. While much of the analytical work presented in this paper focuses on budget execution of public procurement, the tables on budget execution include all activities performed by municipalities, including payment of salaries, transfers, and others<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>The budget execution process in Brazil is similar to that in other countries<sup>2</sup>. It consists of three distinct steps: commitment, verification, and payment. The commitment (empenho) phase is the moment when governments set aside part of the budget appropriated to them for a specific activity, such as buying goods from a supplier or paying salaries of health workers. From a budgetary perspective, this is often seen as the moment an expenditure is recognized, since committed amounts are deducted from the budget appropriation. The second step of the budget execution is the verification (liquida\u00e7\u00e3o). It occurs when the government acknowledges that a certain service or good has been provided. This is the equivalent of recognizing a debt with a provider and is considered an expenditure from an accrual accounting point of view. In fact, if an expenditure was verified but not paid, it is recorded as accounts payable (restos a pagar processados), and, as with firms, increases in this amount might reflect a deterioration in the ability of governments to meet short-term obligations<sup>3</sup>. The final step of the budget execution is the payment (pagamento), when governments transfer the money to their suppliers. </p>"},{"location":"budget_execution/#data","title":"Data","text":"<p>Our municipal budget execution dataset is organized into three tables: commitment, verification, and payment.</p> <p>In the commitment table, one observation is a commitment by one agency in a given municipality. Commitments vary from very large expenses, such as the commitment for the entire wage bill of the mayor's office in a month, to very specific commitments such as the acquisition of replacement parts for a car. Each commitment is often linked to four levels of \"functional programming\" that map the nature of a commitment (such as Transportation &gt; Road Transportation &gt; Road Recovery &gt; Recovery of a specific road in a given street), as well as a text that explicitly describes the nature of the commitment<sup>4</sup>. After an initial commitment, officials can increase or decrease the amounts committed as well as annul them. Across municipalities in our dataset, the quality of tracking these actions after initial commitment varies, but we include initial, increases, annulments, adjustments, and net amounts for each commitment when these are available. Each commitment is also linked to a unique identifier ($id_empenho_bd$) that allows users to connect a commitment to verification and payments linked to them.</p> <p>In the verification table, observations are verifications by some agency in a given municipality, which are always linked to a specific commitment. The key information available for each verification is the date when they happen, the initial value verified, any adjustments to the original value and the final value. One commitment might generate one or more verifications, so each verification is uniquely identified by the variable $id_liquidacao_bd$ and can be connected to commitments by the variable $id_empenho_bd$.</p> <p>Finally, for the payment table, each observation is a payment made to a specific entity. Payments can often (but not always) be linked back to a specific verification. The key information available in the payments table is the date of payment and values. The dataset also includes variables with the names and \"document number\" of payees - these are often unique national identifiers for individuals (CPF) and firms (CNPJ) but are not available for all payments or municipalities. Again, one verification event can lead to one or multiple payments, so payments are uniquely identified by the variable $id_pagamento_bd$ and can be linked back to verification events by $id_liquidacao_bd$ and to commitments by $id_empenho_bd$.</p>"},{"location":"budget_execution/#descriptive-statistics","title":"Descriptive statistics","text":"<p>Statistics for the budget execution dataset are presented in Tabela 1. Our budget execution dataset includes over 880 million observations - over 250 million commitments, around 300 million verifications and over 300 million payments. For all three stages of the budget execution, we present the total number of observations and the total number of distinct events - in some cases, we are unable to assess whether two commitment observations, for example, refer to the same commitment or not. In those cases, we set our respective identifier variable to missing to flag to users that we are unsure whether these are unique events that can be tracked across datasets. Using the budget classification discussed previously, we estimate that between 25%-35% of total budget commitment events are related to the procurement of goods and materials - this is a sample we exploit in more detail in the coming Sections.

SICONFI contains self-reported information on municipalities revenues, expenditures, and balance sheets starting in 1989, with details on amounts per category and budget execution phase (i.e. commitment, verification, payment). These data have been extensively used and validated in empirical research using data on public finances in Brazil \\citep{gadenne_tax_2017,CorbiEtAl2019,shamsuddin_economic_2021}. Moreover, the federal government performs several checks to guarantee an adequate level of quality. Our data is much more granular than SICONFI, measuring individual commitments, verification and payments, but once we aggregate at levels such as municipality-year we should expect to match totals from SICONFI. A natural validation of the quality of our dataset therefore is to compare our aggregates with those provided by SICONFI<sup>6</sup>.</p> <p>In Figure 1, we present the histogram of the percentage deviation of committed amounts from SICONFI, across states. Our key takeaway is that for five states (CE, MG, PB, PE and SP), our aggregates are almost identical to those from SICONFI - for each state, over 75% of deviations are below 1%, and often precisely zero. For PR, RJ and RS our deviations are centered around zero but with larger mass slightly above or slightly below - in both states three-quarters of deviations are in the range [-0.5%, 5%], but with more mass for larger absolute deviations in some municipality-years. We also present the same deviations but considering total committed amounts at the municipality-year-function level, where one observation is, for example, the total amount committed by one city for the Health function in 2020. We present these results in Figure 2, again documenting that our measures of aggregate commitments closely follow those available at SICONFI. </p> <p></p> <p>We also provide the distribution of deviations from SICONFI in verification and payment amounts in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. Here our concordance with SICONFI is less precise - while PB and SP show very small deviations, in the remaining states we systematically overestimate total amounts of verification and payments. The distributions of deviations are somewhat similar across states, centered at around 5%-8% and with some mass up to 15%-20% in some municipality-years - meaning that the aggregate amount in our data exceeds that in SICONFI by that amount. These deviations do not seem to be driven by specific municipalities or to be systematically different across years, suggesting that there are consistent differences between our measures of verification and payments and those of SICONFI.</p> <p>While we are unable to precisely explain those differences, we expect they are partly driven by amounts carried over across fiscal years, the so-called restos a pagar. In most states we are  unable to assert whether payments in a given year were committed and/or verified in the previous year; furthermore, annulments of verifications and cancellations of payments can be common, and are not always precisely measured in our dataset. We believe both of these factors might drive the systematic overestimation of aggregate amounts in our dataset compared to SICONFI. Finally, we also highlight that results in both our dataset and SICONFI are self-reported by municipalities, meaning there could be systematic discrepancies not due to errors in one source, but due to inconsistent reporting by subnational agents.</p> <p>While we document that in some states we systematically overestimate total amounts verified and paid, these deviations $D_{mt}$ are only weakly correlated with municipal characteristics. We perform a predictive OLS exercise regressing $D_{mt}$ on a list of observables including each municipality's log population and log GDP per capita. In \\autoref{tab:deviations_correlates} we report results from regressions with only year fixed effects in odd columns and with year and state fixed effects in even columns. In odd columns we find that deviations are negatively correlated with $ln(Population)$ and positively correlated with $ln(GDP)$. For both deviations in commitment and verification amounts, these correlations become much smaller in magnitude and mostly not statistically different from zero once we include state fixed-effects. For deviations in payment amounts, we still observer marginally significant correlations (at 10% significance level) for both population and GDP - in column (6), a one log point increase in GDP correlates with 0.5 p.p. smaller deviation in payments, or about 12% of the mean. A one log point increase in GDP per capita roughly corresponds to going from p25 to p75 of the distribution, so this is a small magnitude.</p> <p>In sum these results suggest that our data's aggregate deviations from SICONFI totals are partially correlated with municipalities' characteristics, although only weakly.

As a rule, governments are expected to run competitive tenders when buying goods and services. The specific method used, such as reverse auctions, invitations to tender or framework agreements, will depend on the nature of the object to be acquired and its estimated value. In exceptional circumstances (such as when there is only one feasible supplier or during an emergency) or when purchase values are small, officials can waive tenders and directly contract with suppliers (see \\autoref{fig:desc_procur_methods} for more details). </p> <p>Our municipal public procurement dataset is organized into three tables: tender, tender-item, and tender-participant.</p> <p>In the tender table, one observation is a tendering procedure that some agency in a given municipality executes. Tenders are often comprised of several items, so they should be thought of as a batch of items that are separately sold - one tender might contain, for example, ten different items that are purchased from four different suppliers. Each tender often includes a general description of the items being purchased (like \"purchase of cleaning goods for city hall\" or \"hiring of mechanical services\"), classifiers for groups of goods/services, the modality used for the purchase, and the status of the tender (if it was completed, canceled or deserted, for example). It will also sometimes include the total estimated or budgeted value for that batch of goods. Each tender process is uniquely identified by the variable $id_licitacao_bd$.</p> <p>In the tender-item table, each observation is an item, linked to a specific tender. Items will often include a textual description of the specific purchase (e.g., \"cleaning detergent 0.5L\" or \"accounting services\"), quantities, unit prices and total prices. In some cases, the item will separately describe the \"quoted\" prices, before the execution of the tender, and the price for the winning proposal. The item dataset also includes the name and document number of the winning entity, which can be a firm or individual. Each item is uniquely identified by the variable $id_item_bd$ and can be connected to tenders by the variable $id_licitacao_bd$.</p> <p>Finally, in the tender-participant table each observation is a participant in a given tender. Some municipalities will only provide winners in each tender, so in that case these will be the same as those listed in the tender-item table. Others will include all participants in a tender, including those that did not win any contracts. The data includes names and document numbers of each participant, as well as an indicator of whether they are winners. Each participant is uniquely identified by the pair of variables $documento$ and $razao_social$, and can be connected to tenders by the variable $id_licitacao_bd$.</p> <p>For procurement, across the six states covered, we observe over 2.4 million unique tenders and almost 800,000 unique suppliers. Since we observe microdata on each tender and often items, we are able to compute statistics such as the share of tenders that are deserted and/or unsuccessful (e.g., no bidders in a competitive tender) and the average number of items listed in a tender. We can also document, for example, that across states approximately 30%-40% of tenders are not competitive auctions - meaning they are directly awarded to suppliers by means other than an auction - but in terms of total purchase value these non-competitive tenders always represent less than 20% of total amounts. This is consistent with the fact that, similar to other countries, Brazilian law allows small purchases to be performed without competitive auctions \\citep{fazio_rethinking_2022}. We can also compute measures of competitiveness in tenders, such as the number of participants per tender - the average fluctuates between two and four across the municipalities in our sample. The dataset often contains unique identifiers for each supplier, which in Brazil vary if the supplier is an individual or a firm, allowing us to compute the share of suppliers identified as firms (which vary substantially across states, from less than 60% in CE and PB to over 80% in MG). </p> <p>We provide an illustrative example of the nature of our data in Figure 1, highlighting a case in which we can track the entire process of public procurement and budget execution<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p></p> <p>In this figure we zoom in on one case involving the town hall of Abati\u00e1 - a municipality with less than 10,000 inhabitants but relatively high income in the state or Paran\u00e1 - which initiated a tender to procure uniforms for basic health employees, identified by ID 1336360. The tender was officially published in November 2018, with an initial budget of 17,116 BRL. The auction took place on December 13 of the same year, during which bids were received for 23 items, comprising different types of t-shirts and bags. The tender resulted in two winners, one for supplying t-shirts and another for supplying bags. Subsequently, the tender was officially homologated on December 18.</p> <p>One day after the tender's homologation, four separate commitments were made - meaning that the local government set apart funds to pay for the purchases, once goods were delivered. Verification of delivery happened in mid-May 2019, five months after the end of the tender. Less than 30 days later, three separate payments were made to different agents that won the contracts, with total values of 11,377 BRL and 3,890 BRL. For the purchase of this relatively simple good, a total of 235 days elapsed between the tender publication and the last payment.</p> <p>The example above shows the potential of this newly constructed dataset in providing researchers, policy makers, and the civil society with a granular view of how local governments in Brazil acquire goods and services and execute their budgets. It also illustrates the potential for similar datasets to be developed in other countries where scattered data might exist but require upfront investment to be collected, cleaned, and harmonized.</p> CE MG PB PE PR RS Total Number of distinct tenders 271,345 643,442 133,201 220,025 735,632 417,348 2,420,993 Deserted tenders (\\%) - - - 3.1 2.6 0.5 1.2 Unsuccessful tenders (\\%) - - 0.0 6.3 3.0 0.6 1.6 Non-competitive tenders (\\%) 27.6 31.8 38.3 38.0 45.0 45.5 38.6 Non-competitive tenders value (\\%) 10.0 18.0 12.0 15.0 19.0 12.0 14.9 Has item information (\\%) 93.3 100 - - 92.0 100 82.2 Avg. number of items per tender 25.1 25.4 - - 32.2 12.4 23.8 Has participant information (\\%) 94.4 96.5 100 100 92.7 92.2 94.9 Number of distinct participants 189,738 330,745 50,236 94,864 175,024 119,322 959,929 Number of distinct suppliers 137,997 301,447 43,548 66,466 154,301 91,609 795,368 Firms among suppliers (\\%) 55.4 83.2 47.8 66.4 71.6 79.0 72.3 Avg. number of participants per tender 2.8 2.3 2.6 3.9 3.2 3.6 3.1 Avg. number of suppliers per tender 1.5 2.1 2.0 1.4 2.2 2.2 1.9 Number of distinct municipalities 184 853 223 184 392 497 2333 <p>This table presents the descriptive statistics from the public procurement dataset.
